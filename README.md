## RW

An experiment in code presentation.

### WHY?

Real takes detail. Document jumps or interactive tv make for astronomical lack of imagination in an era that substitutes curios for wonderous.

### HOW?

Sparse matrices are extremely easy to read. Machines already excel at them.

Sequence of instructions, hierarchy of syntax, web of bindings. All three need to be ready
for code to be present.

The actual experiment here is to anchor the sequential spine along the diagonal of an adjacency matrix.

Orthogonal frames nest very easily. Control-flow and data-flow graphs are not blurred. We are not talking about a half-baked graph layout. The interwoven structure can be read from the links scattered across the matrix, faithfully and transparently.
Cells around the diagonal represent local links; reaching further out around the corner.

Here is an initial rendering on spreadsheet, start from the bottom right and climb up to return statement
on the top left. Work against gravitational potential is too good to pass.

Here is the current presentation for factorial computation.

Here is for fibonacci with some pointer operations on the stack.

We let go of static renderings beyond these examples. At least in full detail. Some
form of folding is in the works.

### WHEN?

It would not have been wise to deal with sparse matrices on paper. Digital displays, on the other hand, is full of surprises.

### ASPIRATIONS

It would be good to have tools and toys we can break and make again. We need couplings we can trace and coalesce.

OS-COMPILER-EDITOR trio got somehow buried under the drag-n-drop interfaces and object oriented technology.
Easing the burden on heroic compilers and creating dwelling space close to machines may provide worthy challenges.

Streamlined incremental compilation infrastructure is probably not a utopian dream.

The same spinal layout can be applied in different settings. Graphs are apparently all around. This will be a first in a series of experiments to play with the representation as it is unique in being transparent.
